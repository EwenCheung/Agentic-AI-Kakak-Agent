## üéØ Problem Statement

Most chatbot only handles preset answers, so if a customer phrases a question differently, the bot gets stuck

Staff then have to manually check documents, reply, and update calendars ‚Äî leading to delayed responses, missed bookings, and frustrated customers

- Handle multiple channels (Telegram, future: WhatsApp, Web Chat) 
- Understand context and maintain conversation memory
- Access and search through company knowledge bases
- Manage appointments and calendar scheduling
- Create and track support tickets
- Provide daily business insights and summaries

**Why This Matters:**
- 67% of customers expect 24/7 support availability
- Poor customer service costs businesses $75 billion annually in the US alone
- SMEs lose 30% of potential customers due to delayed response times
- Manual ticket management reduces productivity by 40%

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### Agent-Based Architecture
The system employs a **hierarchical multi-agent approach** where each agent specializes in specific domains:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Central coordinator with memory awareness that analyzes user intent and delegates to specialist agents
2. **Scheduler Agent**: Manages calendar operations and appointment booking with Google Calendar integration
3. **Ticketing Agent**: Creates, updates, and tracks support tickets with priority management
4. **Web Search Agent**: Retrieves real-time information from the internet when knowledge base is insufficient
5. **Daily Digest Agent**: Generates business insights and summaries from tickets and calendar events

### AI Technologies Used:
- **Large Language Models**: Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku) for natural language processing
- **Vector Embeddings**: Amazon Titan Embed for semantic search
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: ChromaDB for knowledge base search
- **Document Processing**: Docling for PDF parsing and chunking
- **Agent Framework**: Strands AI for agent orchestration
- **Memory System**: Mem0 for conversation memory and user context persistence
- **Real-time Search**: Tavily API for current information retrieval

### Integration Strategy:
- **Telegram Bot API** for real-time messaging
- **Google Calendar API** for scheduling management  
- **SQLite Database** for data persistence and conversation memory
- **FastAPI** for scalable backend architecture
- **React Frontend** for business dashboard
- **Background Worker** for asynchronous message processing
- **Memory System (Mem0)** for conversation context and user preferences

## How Kakak Agent Works
1. A customer sends a message on Telegram.
2. The message is instantly received by our Telegram bot.
3. Telegram forwards the message to our backend system using a secure webhook.
4. The backend adds the message to a queue, so nothing gets missed‚Äîeven if lots of people are messaging at once.
5. A background worker picks up the message from the queue and gets to work.
6. The Orchestrator Agent (the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of the system) reads the message, checks past conversations, and figures out what the customer needs.
7. If needed, the Orchestrator asks specialist agents for help‚Äîlike the Scheduler for appointments, Ticketing for support issues, or Web Search for real-time info.
8. The agents can look up information in your company‚Äôs knowledge base, check the calendar, or even search the web to find the best answer.
9. Once the right response is ready, the system sends it back to the customer on Telegram‚Äîfast and friendly.
10. Meanwhile, all conversations and actions are saved, so the agent remembers each customer and can provide personalized service next time.
11. Business owners and staff can monitor everything, upload new documents, and adjust settings easily from the dashboard.
