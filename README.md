## üéØ Problem Statement

Most chatbot only handles preset answers, so if a customer phrases a question differently, the bot gets stuck

Staff then have to manually check documents, reply, and update calendars ‚Äî leading to delayed responses, missed bookings, and frustrated customers

- Handle multiple channels (Telegram, future: WhatsApp, Web Chat) 
- Understand context and maintain conversation memory
- Access and search through company knowledge bases
- Manage appointments and calendar scheduling
- Create and track support tickets
- Provide daily business insights and summaries

**Why This Matters:**
- 67% of customers expect 24/7 support availability
- Poor customer service costs businesses $75 billion annually in the US alone
- SMEs lose 30% of potential customers due to delayed response times
- Manual ticket management reduces productivity by 40%

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### Agent-Based Architecture
The system employs a **hierarchical multi-agent approach** where each agent specializes in specific domains:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Central coordinator with memory awareness that analyzes user intent and delegates to specialist agents
2. **Scheduler Agent**: Manages calendar operations and appointment booking with Google Calendar integration
3. **Ticketing Agent**: Creates, updates, and tracks support tickets with priority management
4. **Web Search Agent**: Retrieves real-time information from the internet when knowledge base is insufficient
5. **Daily Digest Agent**: Generates business insights and summaries from tickets and calendar events

### AI Technologies Used:
- **Large Language Models**: Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku) for natural language processing
- **Vector Embeddings**: Amazon Titan Embed for semantic search
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: ChromaDB for knowledge base search
- **Document Processing**: Docling for PDF parsing and chunking
- **Agent Framework**: Strands AI for agent orchestration
- **Memory System**: Mem0 for conversation memory and user context persistence
- **Real-time Search**: Tavily API for current information retrieval

### Integration Strategy:
- **Telegram Bot API** for real-time messaging
- **Google Calendar API** for scheduling management  
- **SQLite Database** for data persistence and conversation memory
- **FastAPI** for scalable backend architecture
- **React Frontend** for business dashboard
- **Background Worker** for asynchronous message processing
- **Memory System (Mem0)** for conversation context and user preferences
